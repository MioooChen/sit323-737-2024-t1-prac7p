## Deploy and manage a simple Node.js application on Kubernetes.
## The following is a detailed summary of steps and operations:

Build the Docker image:
Created a Node.js application locally.
Wrote a Dockerfile and built a Docker image.
The Docker image is tagged and ready to be pushed to Docker Hub.
Push the image to Docker Hub:
Make sure the Docker image has the correct tags and push it to Docker Hub so that it can be used in the Kubernetes cluster.
Set up a Kubernetes deployment:
A deployment.yaml file is created that defines the details of the Kubernetes deployment, including the images used, the number of replicas, and the configuration.
Apply the deployment file to Kubernetes to initialize the Pod deployment.
Set up the Kubernetes service:
Created a service.yaml file and defined a service to expose the Node.js application.
The service uses the LoadBalancer type so that the application can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
Apply the service configuration to create and run the service in Kubernetes.
To access and verify the app:
Use the minikube service command to get the URL of the service.
Access the URL through your browser and verify that the Node.js application responds to the request correctly.
Monitor and manage:
Use the kubectl command to monitor the status of your deployment and service status.
Check the status of Pods to ensure they are in a healthy running state.
